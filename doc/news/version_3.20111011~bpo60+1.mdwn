git-annex 3.20111011~bpo60+1 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Fix referring to remotes by uuid.
   * New or changed repository descriptions in uuid.log now have a timestamp,
     which is used to ensure the newest description is used when the uuid.log
     has been merged.
   * Note that older versions of git-annex will display the timestamp as part
     of the repository description, which is ugly but otherwise harmless.
   * Add timestamps to trust.log and remote.log too.
   * git-annex-shell: Added the --uuid option.
   * git-annex now asks git-annex-shell to verify that it's operating in
     the expected repository.
   * Note that this git-annex will not interoperate with remotes using
     older versions of git-annex-shell.
   * Now supports git's insteadOf configuration, to modify the url
     used to access a remote. Note that pushInsteadOf is not used;
     that and pushurl are reserved for actual git pushes. Closes: #[644278](http://bugs.debian.org/644278)
   * status: List all known repositories.
   * When displaying a list of repositories, show git remote names
     in addition to their descriptions.
   * Add locking to avoid races when changing the git-annex branch.
   * Various speed improvements gained by using ByteStrings.
   * Contain the zombie hordes."""]]
